## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 68%, 40% which converts to the hex code #3385FF. This color creates a calm, intellectual mood that helps user to focus on content of the prompt.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% which converts to the hex code #F0F5FF. Background complements primary color and provides an ideal canvas to allow primary content to stand out.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 50%, 40% which converts to the hex code #339999. Accent provides interface contrast, and suggests streamlined communication
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern and readable interface. This font will be used for both headlines and body text.
- Use a consistent set of line icons for actions and navigation.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout with a focus on readability and ease of use.
- Use subtle animations for feedback and transitions.
- Contrast: All text must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- Simplicity: Focus on essential features and remove every element that isn't absolutely necessary. A good design has as little "design" as possible.
- Visual Hierarchy: Guide the user's eye by emphasizing the most important elements with contrast, size, and weight.
- Structure: Group related items together (Proximity) and align elements along invisible lines (Alignment).
- Whitespace: Embrace ample whitespace to frame content, improve focus, and give the design room to breathe.
- Font Limitation: Use one single sans-serif typeface for the interface to ensure legibility.
- Type Scale: Use a predefined and consistent type scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px).
- Readability: Body text should be 16px-18px with a line-height of at least 1.5.
- Font Weights: Use only regular (400-500) and bold (600-700) weights.
